### creative portion of the assignment
* The app allows you to delete single food item by clicking on the item from the listView.
* The app has a Clear all button which can clear out all the food items in the adapter and updates remaining calories and total calories.
* The app has a Reset button which allows you to re-submit the initial calories.

* Why did you choose this feature?
	* It helps the users to modify their food schedule. When the calories are too much, naturally, they will delete one or
	  some of the food items.
* How did you implement it?
	I use setOnItemClickListener to locate a single food item on the listView. And create a dialog to notify the user.
